# AniyaaList

A userscript that brings a new way to experience Nyaa.

## Notice

AniyaaList still in early development and it only run on torrent view page for now.

## Installation

1. Get Tampermonkey userscript manager for your browser. ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/))
2. Install script from [here](https://github.com/MrYuto/AniyaaList/raw/main/dist/aniyaa-list.user.js).

## Features

- Dark blue theme
- Anilist widget for torrent view page

## Issues

- **Media detection** still isn't accurate, especially if it's a sequel season and the regular expression that is being used is pretty simple so a parsing issue is expected for some encoders.

- I don't have a Nyaa account because of IP restrictions so I have no idea what things need to be fixed on the view page if you are logged in.

## Todos

- Add theme support for other pages

- Improve Anilist widget experience
  - Better media discovery accuracy
  - Give users the ability to change search result
  - Helpful error messages
  - Add Link to Anilist and MAL
  - Add Anilist user account interaction
